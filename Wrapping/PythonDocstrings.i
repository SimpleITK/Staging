 f[ I_t = F_{mbox{minmax}} |nabla I| f]  
wheref$ F_{mbox{minmax}} = min(kappa,0) f$ iff$ mbox{Avg}_{mbox{stencil}}(x) f$ is less than or equal tof$ T_{thresold} f$ andf$ max(kappa,0) f$ , otherwise.f$ kappa f$ is the mean curvature of the iso-brightness contour at pointf$ x f$ .
In min/max curvature flow, movement is turned on or off depending on the scale of the noise one wants to remove. Switching depends on the average image value of a region of radiusf$ R f$ around each point. The choice off$ R f$ , the stencil radius, governs the scale of the noise to be removed.
The threshold valuef$ T_{threshold} f$ is a user specified value which discriminates between the two pixel classes.
This filter make use of the multi-threaded finite difference solver hierarchy. Updates are computed using a BinaryMinMaxCurvatureFlowFunctionobject. A zero flux Neumann boundary condition is used when computing derivatives near the data boundary.
warning This filter assumes that the input and output types have the same dimensions. This filter also requires that the output image pixels are of a real type. This filter works for any dimensional images.

%feature("docstring") itk::simple::CurvatureFlowImageFilter "Denoise an image using curvature driven flow.

 CurvatureFlowImageFilterimplements a curvature driven image denoising algorithm. Iso-brightness contours in the grayscale input image are viewed as a level set. The level set is then evolved using a curvature-based speed function:
 f[ I_t = kappa |nabla I| f]  wheref$ kappa f$ is the curvature.
The advantage of this approach is that sharp boundaries are preserved with smoothing occuring only within a region. However, it should be noted that continuous application of this scheme will result in the eventual removal of all information as each contour shrinks to zero and disappear.
Note that unlike level set segmentation algorithms, the image to be denoised is already the level set and can be set directly as the input using the SetInput()method.
This filter has two parameters: the number of update iterations to be performed and the timestep between each update.
The timestep should be small enough to ensure numerical stability. Stability is guarantee when the timestep meets the CFL (Courant-Friedrichs-Levy) condition. Broadly speaking, this condition ensures that each contour does not move more than one grid position at each timestep. In the literature, the timestep is typically user specified and have to manually tuned to the application.
This filter make use of the multi-threaded finite difference solver hierarchy. Updates are computed using a CurvatureFlowFunctionobject. A zero flux Neumann boundary condition when computing derivatives near the data boundary.
This filter may be streamed. To support streaming this filter produces a padded output which takes into account edge effects. The size of the padding is m_NumberOfIterations on each edge. Users of this filter should only make use of the center valid central region.
warning This filter assumes that the input and output types have the same dimensions. This filter also requires that the output image pixels are of a floating point type. This filter works for any dimensional images.

Double threshold addresses the difficulty in selecting a threshold that will select the objects of interest without selecting extraneous objects. Double threshold considers two threshold ranges: a narrow range and a wide range (where the wide range encompasses the narrow range).

If the narrow range was used for a traditional threshold, then too few pixels may survive the threshold.
Double threshold uses the narrow threshold image as a marker image and the wide threshold image as a mask image in the geodesic dilation. Essentially, the marker image (narrow threshold) is dilated but constrained to lie within the mask image (wide threshold).

%feature("docstring") itk::simple::GeodesicActiveContourLevelSetImageFilter "Segments structures in images based on a user supplied edge potential map.

par IMPORTANT
The SegmentationLevelSetImageFilterclass and the GeodesicActiveContourLevelSetFunctionclass contain additional information necessary to gain full understanding of how to use this filter.
par OVERVIEW
This class is a level set method segmentation filter. An initial contour is propagated outwards (or inwards) until it ''sticks'' to the shape boundaries. This is done by using a level set speed function based on a user supplied edge potential map.
par INPUTS
This filter requires two inputs. The first input is a initial level set. The initial level set is a real image which contains the initial contour/surface as the zero level set. For example, a signed distance function from the initial contour/surface is typically used. Unlike the simpler ShapeDetectionLevelSetImageFilterthe initial contour does not have to lie wholly within the shape to be segmented. The intiial contour is allow to overlap the shape boundary. The extra advection term in the update equation behaves like a doublet and attracts the contour to the boundary. This approach for segmentation follows that of Caselles et al (1997).
par The second input is the feature image. For this filter, this is the edge potential map. General characteristics of an edge potential map is that it has values close to zero in regions near the edges and values close to one inside the shape itself. Typically, the edge potential map is compute from the image gradient, for example:
 f[ g(I) = 1 / ( 1 + | (nabla * G)(I)| ) f]   f[ g(I) = exp^{-|(nabla * G)(I)|} f]  
wheref$ I f$ is image intensity andf$ (nabla * G) f$ is the derivative of Gaussian operator.
par See SegmentationLevelSetImageFilterand SparseFieldLevelSetImageFilterfor more information on Inputs.
par PARAMETERS
The PropagationScaling parameter can be used to switch from propagation outwards (POSITIVE scaling parameter) versus propagating inwards (NEGATIVE scaling parameter).
This implementation allows the user to set the weights between the propagation, advection and curvature term using methods SetPropagationScaling(), SetAdvectionScaling(), SetCurvatureScaling(). In general, the larger the CurvatureScaling, the smoother the resulting contour. To follow the implementation in Caselles et al paper, set the PropagationScaling tof$ c f$ (the inflation or ballon force) and AdvectionScaling and CurvatureScaling both to 1.0.
par OUTPUTS
The filter outputs a single, scalar, real-valued image. Negative values in the output image represent the inside of the segmented region and positive values in the image represent the outside of the segmented region. The zero crossings of the image correspond to the position of the propagating front.
par See SparseFieldLevelSetImageFilterand SegmentationLevelSetImageFilterfor more information.

par IMPORTANT
The SegmentationLevelSetImageFilterclass and the GeodesicActiveContourLevelSetFunctionclass contain additional information necessary to gain full understanding of how to use this filter.
par OVERVIEW
This class is a level set method segmentation filter. An initial contour is propagated outwards (or inwards) until it ''sticks'' to the shape boundaries. This is done by using a level set speed function based on a user supplied edge potential map.
par INPUTS
This filter requires two inputs. The first input is a initial level set. The initial level set is a real image which contains the initial contour/surface as the zero level set. For example, a signed distance function from the initial contour/surface is typically used. Unlike the simpler ShapeDetectionLevelSetImageFilterthe initial contour does not have to lie wholly within the shape to be segmented. The intiial contour is allow to overlap the shape boundary. The extra advection term in the update equation behaves like a doublet and attracts the contour to the boundary. This approach for segmentation follows that of Caselles et al (1997).
par The second input is the feature image. For this filter, this is the edge potential map. General characteristics of an edge potential map is that it has values close to zero in regions near the edges and values close to one inside the shape itself. Typically, the edge potential map is compute from the image gradient, for example:
 f[ g(I) = 1 / ( 1 + | (nabla * G)(I)| ) f]   f[ g(I) = exp^{-|(nabla * G)(I)|} f]  
wheref$ I f$ is image intensity andf$ (nabla * G) f$ is the derivative of Gaussian operator.
par See SegmentationLevelSetImageFilterand SparseFieldLevelSetImageFilterfor more information on Inputs.
par PARAMETERS
The PropagationScaling parameter can be used to switch from propagation outwards (POSITIVE scaling parameter) versus propagating inwards (NEGATIVE scaling parameter).
This implementation allows the user to set the weights between the propagation, advection and curvature term using methods SetPropagationScaling(), SetAdvectionScaling(), SetCurvatureScaling(). In general, the larger the CurvatureScaling, the smoother the resulting contour. To follow the implementation in Caselles et al paper, set the PropagationScaling tof$ c f$ (the inflation or ballon force) and AdvectionScaling and CurvatureScaling both to 1.0.
par OUTPUTS
The filter outputs a single, scalar, real-valued image. Negative values in the output image represent the inside of the segmented region and positive values in the image represent the outside of the segmented region. The zero crossings of the image correspond to the position of the propagating front.

Geodesic dilation operates on a marker image and a mask image. The marker image is dilated using an elementary structuring element (neighborhood of radius one using only the face connected neighbors). The resulting image is then compared with the mask image.

Geodesic dilation is run either one iteration or until convergence. In the convergence case, the filter is equivalent to reconstruction by dilation. This filter is implemented to handle both scenarios. The one iteration case is multi-threaded.

This has the effect of smoothing over the high parts of the noise in the image without smoothing over large changes in intensity (region boundaries). See the HMinimaImageFilterto suppress the local minima whose depth is less than h intensity units below the (local) background.
If the output of HMaximaImageFilteris subtracted from the original image, the signicant peaks in the image can be identified. This is what the HConvexImageFilterprovides.
This filter uses the ReconstructionByDilationImageFilter. It provides its own input as the mask input to the geodesic dilation. The marker image for the geodesic dilation is the input image minus the height parameter h.
Geodesic morphology and the H-Maxima algorithm is described in Chapter 6 of Pierre Soille's book Morphological ImageAnalysis: Principles and Applications, Second Edition, Springer, 2003.

Set/Get the flag for normalizing the gaussian over scale-space.
This flag enables the analysis of the differential shape of features independent of their size ( both pixels and physical size ). Following the notation of Tony Lindeberg:
Let f[ L(x; t) = g(x; t) ast f(x) f]  be the scale-space representation of image f[ f(x) f]  where f[ g(x; t) = frac{1}{ sqrt{ 2 pi t} } exp{ left( -frac{x^2}{ 2 t } right) } f]  is the Gaussian function and f[astf]  denotes convolution. This is a change from above with f[ t = sigma^2 f]  .
Then the normalized derivative operator for normalized coordinates across scale is:
 f[ partial_xi = sqrt{t} partial_x f]  
The resulting scaling factor is f[ sigma^N f]  where N is the order of the derivative.
When this flag is ON the filter will be normalized in such a way that the values of derivatives are not biased by the size of the object. That is to say the maximum value a feature reaches across scale is independent of the scale of the object.
For analyzing an image across scale-space you want to enable this flag. It is disabled by default.
note Not all scale space axioms are satisfied by this filter, some are only approximated. Particularly, at fine scales ( say less than 1 pixel ) other methods such as a discrete Gaussian kernel should be considered.

par IMPORTANT
The SegmentationLevelSetImageFilterclass and the ShapeDetectionLevelSetFunctionclass contain additional information necessary to gain full understanding of how to use this filter.
par OVERVIEW
This class is a level set method segmentation filter. An initial contour is propagated outwards (or inwards) until it ''sticks'' to the shape boundaries. This is done by using a level set speed function based on a user supplied edge potential map. This approach for segmentation follows that of Malladi et al (1995).
par INPUTS
This filter requires two inputs. The first input is a initial level set. The initial level set is a real image which contains the initial contour/surface as the zero level set. For example, a signed distance function from the initial contour/surface is typically used. Note that for this algorithm the initial contour has to be wholly within (or wholly outside) the structure to be segmented.
par The second input is the feature image. For this filter, this is the edge potential map. General characteristics of an edge potential map is that it has values close to zero in regions near the edges and values close to one inside the shape itself. Typically, the edge potential map is compute from the image gradient, for example:
 f[ g(I) = 1 / ( 1 + | (nabla * G)(I)| ) f]   f[ g(I) = exp^{-|(nabla * G)(I)|} f]  
wheref$ I f$ is image intensity andf$ (nabla * G) f$ is the derivative of Gaussian operator.
par See SegmentationLevelSetImageFilterand SparseFieldLevelSetImageFilterfor more information on Inputs.
par PARAMETERS
The PropagationScaling parameter can be used to switch from propagation outwards (POSITIVE scaling parameter) versus propagating inwards (NEGATIVE scaling parameter).
The smoothness of the resulting contour/surface can be adjusted using a combination of PropagationScaling and CurvatureScaling parameters. The larger the CurvatureScaling parameter, the smoother the resulting contour. The CurvatureScaling parameter should be non-negative for proper operation of this algorithm. To follow the implementation in Malladi et al paper, set the PropagtionScaling tof$pm 1.0f$ and CurvatureScaling tof$ epsilon f$ .
Note that there is no advection term for this filter. Setting the advection scaling will have no effect.
par OUTPUTS
The filter outputs a single, scalar, real-valued image. Negative values in the output image represent the inside of the segmentated region and positive values in the image represent the outside of the segmented region. The zero crossings of the image correspond to the position of the propagating front.

NOTE: The physical centers of the input and output will be the same. Because of this, the Origin of the output may not be the same as the Origin of the input. Since this filter produces an image which is a different resolution, origin and with different pixel spacing than its input image, it needs to override several of the methods defined in ProcessObjectin order to properly manage the pipeline execution model. In particular, this filter overrides ProcessObject::GenerateInputRequestedRegion()and ProcessObject::GenerateOutputInformation().
This filter is implemented as a multithreaded filter. It provides a ThreadedGenerateData()method for its implementation.
